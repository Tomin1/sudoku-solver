This version is called "power"

Solves most sudokus and prints the best answers it gets
Uses multithreading and has small a commandline interface
Uses some Exceptions
Prints statusbar while running
Don't try to solve sudokus that can't really be solved
or you can but it will take a very long time and you'll 
run out of memory for sure.
