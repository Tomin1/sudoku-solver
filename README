This version is called "unneeded"

Solves most sudokus and prints the best answers it gets
Uses multithreading and has small a commandline interface
Prints statusbar while running
Don't try to solve sudokus that can't really be solved
or you can but it will take a very long time and you'll 
run out of memory for sure.

The very first version to support python 3!
The use of multithreading doesn't mean that program actually 
uses multiple cores, because of GIL this version runs single-threaded
